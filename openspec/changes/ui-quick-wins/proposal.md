# UI Quick Wins - Holy Trinity Features

## Why
Current UI lacks essential user experience features that are standard in modern applications. Users need immediate visual feedback, theme customization, and efficient navigation shortcuts.

## What Changes
- **Theme Toggle**: Dark/light mode switcher in header
- **Toast Notifications**: Replace console.log with user-friendly notifications  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user navigation with help overlay

## Impact
- Affected specs: [ui-components, user-experience]
- Affected code: [Header.svelte, new Toast system, global keyboard handler]
- **BREAKING**: None - purely additive features
- User satisfaction: +40% (estimated)
- Development time: 3-4 hours total
