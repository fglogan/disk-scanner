## Overview

A **comprehensive, multi-layered analysis** of the Disk Bloat Scanner project has been completed. The analysis applies the **Tempext Engineering Standard (TES-2025 v6.9)** methodology, specifically the **EDGS (Event-Driven Gate Scheduling)** framework, eliminating human effort quantifiers in favor of event-based progression.

**Key Achievement:** Project analyzed from 3 perspectives:
1. **Current State:** What works, what doesn't
2. **Best Practices:** How to modernize using TES-2025
3. **Execution Plan:** Event-driven scheduling with gated progression
